fov = tan(h / 1) = tan(h)
h = tan^-1(fov)

the surface go from -h to h and -w to w
we describe point as: [ alpha * u + B * r ] where u is ip and r is right

we describe ray: [ F + h * y * u + w * x * r ] where F is if forward vec (orientation) and x and y very from -1 to 1

translate from pixel screen to -1 to 1 system:
	newPx = 2px/pw - 1
	newPy = 2py/ph - 1

forwarde vector: target - origin
right: forward cross upguide
up: right cross forward
